# MLOps-zoomcamp final project
This is the final project for MLOps zoomcamp course. In this project, I consider the problem of customer sentiment analysis for a product on a website. The problem is described as "Given Review about clothing on E-commerce predict whether the custoomer will recommed it to her friends or not". 

I wrote several blog posts about this project and explained the codes and steps from model training to deployment. You can find them here:

I will add mode contents to the current blog posts and will add more tools to the stack as I learn more.
